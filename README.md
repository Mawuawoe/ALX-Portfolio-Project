# ALX Portfolio Project

This project fulfills a requirement for the online Software Engineering program at ALX, where learners are tasked with creating their own projects to demonstrate their understanding of backend and frontend concepts. For my project, I developed the Salinity App for Electrochem GH LTD, a salt production company in Ghana.

The Salinity App is a specialized web application designed to streamline and automate the tracking, monitoring, and analysis of salinity levels in the salt production process. It enables Brine Attendants to manually log salinity and brine levels across various crystallizing pans and reservoirs. Additionally, the app provides Production Managers with real-time access to this data through an intuitive dashboard, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency.


## Features
- Data Entry: Brine Attendants can log into the system, select specific pans, and enter salinity readings along with the brine levels.
- Monitoring & Visualization: The app presents Production Managers with an up-to-date overview of salinity levels across all pans, allowing for informed decision-making and optimization of the salt production process.
- Reporting: Managers can generate reports based on specific time periods, and export the data in formats like CSV
